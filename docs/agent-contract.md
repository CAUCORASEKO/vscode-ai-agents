# Agent Contract

Every agent in this repository follows the same structure.

## Required sections

1. Role
2. Core rules
3. When to respond
4. Output format
5. Constraints

This consistency is intentional.

It allows:
- Predictable behavior
- Easy comparison between agents
- Safe extension of the system

If an agent does not follow this contract,
it should not be added to the repository.
